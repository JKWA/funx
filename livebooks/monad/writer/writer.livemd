# Funx.Monad.Writer

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:funx, "0.6.1"}
])
```

## Overview

The `Funx.Monad.Writer` module defines the Writer monad, which threads a log alongside a computed result.

Logs are accumulated using a `Monoid` implementation, injected lazily at runtime. This makes the Writer monad flexible and monoid-polymorphic—supporting lists, strings, or any user-defined monoid.

## Core functions

* `pure/1` – Wraps a result with an empty log.
* `writer/1` – Wraps a result and an explicit log.
* `tell/1` – Emits a log with no result.
* `tap/2` – Executes a side-effect function on the value without affecting the Writer's value or log.
* `listen/1` – Returns both result and log as a pair.
* `censor/2` – Applies a function to transform the final log.
* `pass/1` – Uses a log-transforming function returned from within the computation.
* `run/2` – Executes the Writer and returns a `%Writer.Result{}` with result and log.
* `eval/2` – Executes and returns only the result.
* `exec/2` – Executes and returns only the log.

By default, the `ListConcat` monoid is used unless a different monoid is passed to `run`, `eval`, or `exec`.

This module also implements the `Funx.Monad` protocol.

## Function Examples

```elixir
import Funx.Monad.Writer
alias Funx.Monad
alias Funx.Tappable
alias Funx.Monad.Writer
```

### pure/1

Wraps a value with no log.

```elixir
writer = pure(42)
```

```elixir
result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### Monad.map/2

Applies a function to the value inside a `Writer` monad. The log is preserved.

This function is from the `Funx.Monad` module, not `Funx.Monad.Writer`.

```elixir
writer = pure(5)
```

```elixir
mapped = Monad.map(writer, fn x -> x * 2 end)
```

```elixir
result = run(mapped)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### Monad.bind/2

Applies a function that returns a `Writer` to the value inside a `Writer` monad. This is also known as "flatMap" in other languages.

The logs from both Writers are combined using the monoid.

This function is from the `Funx.Monad` module, not `Funx.Monad.Writer`.

```elixir
writer = pure(5)
```

```elixir
bound = Monad.bind(writer, fn x ->
  tell([:computed, x])
  |> Monad.bind(fn _ -> pure(x * 2) end)
end)
```

```elixir
result = run(bound)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### Monad.ap/2

Applies a function wrapped in a `Writer` to a value wrapped in a `Writer`.

The logs from both Writers are combined using the monoid.

This function is from the `Funx.Monad` module, not `Funx.Monad.Writer`.

```elixir
func_writer = pure(&(&1 + 10))
```

```elixir
value_writer = writer({7, [:initial]})
```

```elixir
applied = Monad.ap(func_writer, value_writer)
```

```elixir
result = run(applied)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### writer/1

Wraps both a value and a raw log into the Writer context.

```elixir
writer = writer({:ok, [:step1, :step2]})
```

```elixir
result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### tell/1

Appends a log value using the monoid, returning `:ok` as the result.

```elixir
writer = tell([:event])
```

```elixir
result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### tap/2

Executes a side-effect function on the value without affecting the Writer's value or log.

**Important**: `tap` does NOT add to the Writer's log. Use `tell/1` if you want to add to the log.

Useful for debugging, external logging, or side effects separate from the computation's log.

```elixir
# Side effect that doesn't add to log
writer =
  pure(42)
  |> Tappable.tap(&IO.inspect(&1, label: "debug"))

result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log  # Empty - tap doesn't add to log!
```

```elixir
# Compare with tell (adds to log)
writer =
  pure(42)
  |> Monad.bind(fn x ->
    tell(["processed #{x}"])
    |> Monad.map(fn _ -> x end)
  end)

result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.log  # Contains ["processed 42"]
```

### listen/1

Captures the current log and returns it alongside the result.

The log remains unchanged—only the result is modified to include it.

```elixir
writer = writer({"done", [:start, :finish]})
```

```elixir
listened = listen(writer)
```

```elixir
result = run(listened)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### censor/2

Transforms the final log by applying a function to it.

The result remains unchanged—only the log is modified.

```elixir
writer = writer({"ok", [:a, :b]})
```

```elixir
censored = censor(writer, fn log -> Enum.reverse(log) end)
```

```elixir
result = run(censored)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### pass/1

Applies a log-transforming function that is returned from within the computation.

This allows the result of a computation to include not only a value, but also
a function that modifies the final accumulated log.

The input to `pass/1` must be a Writer containing a tuple `{result, f}`, where
`f` is a function from log to log. This function will be applied to the final log
just before it's returned.

```elixir
result =
  pure({"done", fn log -> log ++ [:transformed] end})
  |> pass()
  |> run()
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### run/2

Executes the Writer and returns both the result and the final accumulated log.

By default, it uses `ListConcat` unless a monoid is explicitly passed.

```elixir
writer = writer({"ok", [:a, :b]})
```

```elixir
result = run(writer)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### exec/2

Executes the Writer and returns only the final accumulated log.

Uses `ListConcat` by default.

```elixir
writer =
  writer({:ok, [:step1]})
  |> Monad.bind(fn _ -> tell([:step2]) end)
```

```elixir
exec(writer)
```

### eval/2

Executes the Writer and returns only the final result value.

Uses `ListConcat` by default.

```elixir
writer =
  writer({10, [:init]})
  |> Monad.bind(fn x ->
    tell([:logged])
    |> Monad.bind(fn _ -> pure(x * 2) end)
  end)
```

```elixir
eval(writer)
```

### Combining Writer Operations

```elixir
computation =
  pure(1)
  |> Monad.bind(fn x ->
    tell([:step1, x])
    |> Monad.bind(fn _ ->
      pure(x + 2)
      |> Monad.bind(fn y ->
        tell([:step2, y])
        |> Monad.bind(fn _ ->
          pure(y * 3)
          |> Monad.bind(fn z ->
            tell([:final, z])
            |> Monad.map(fn _ -> z end)
          end)
        end)
      end)
    end)
  end)
```

```elixir
result = run(computation)
```

```elixir
result.value
```

```elixir
result.log
```

### Using Different Monoids

You can use different monoids with Writer by passing them to `run/2`, `eval/2`, or `exec/2`:

```elixir
# Using String concatenation monoid
string_writer =
  pure("Hello")
  |> Monad.bind(fn x ->
    tell(" ")
    |> Monad.bind(fn _ ->
      tell("World")
      |> Monad.map(fn _ -> x end)
    end)
  end)
```

```elixir
# For demonstration, let's run with ListConcat (default)
result = run(string_writer)
```

```elixir
result.log
```
